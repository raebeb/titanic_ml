# Titanic Survival Prediction :ship: :ocean:

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic would have survived, based on their characteristics like age, sex, class, etc. The model is built using a neural network in Python with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Purpose :dart:

The primary purpose of this project is to practice and learn the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning. It is an exploratory project created to improve my understanding of data handling, model building, and model evaluation.  
source of the data and exercise: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview
